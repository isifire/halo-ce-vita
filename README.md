# Halo: Combat Evolved for the PS Vita

A native PlayStation Vita port of **Halo: Combat Evolved**, built from the
decompilation of the Xbox game and based on the native LibGxm port by [BirchWoodGod](https://github.com/BirchWoodGod/halo-ce-vita). It is not an emulator: the game's own code
is compiled for the Vita's ARM processor, and its Direct3D rendering is
translated natively to the Vita's GPU.

**No game data is included.** You need your own Xbox copy of Halo: Combat
Evolved.

## What works

- The whole campaign from the menus, with checkpoints, saves and Save and
  Quit, cinematics, and the movies (converted to MP4, see below).
- Multiplayer maps on your own (split screen with one player), and system
  link over Wi-Fi with other Vitas or the Linux/Windows builds of the port.
- Profiles, controller settings and the game's settings menus.
- A settings panel for the Vita's quality and control options: hold
  **Select + Start** in game.
- 30 fps in cinematics and most of the campaign; the largest fights (The
  Silent Cartographer's beach) run in the high teens to low twenties.

## Install

### What you need

- A PS Vita or PS TV with HENkaku/Ensō (firmware 3.60 to 3.74) and
  [VitaShell](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/releases).
- About 1.5 GB free on `ux0:` (the game keeps decompressed copies of the
  levels it loads).
- Your own **Xbox** copy of Halo: Combat Evolved (the disc, or an image of
  it). All versions of the Xbox game work. The PC version's maps do not.

### Steps

1. **Download `halo.vpk`** from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/BirchWoodGod/halo-ce-vita/releases/latest).
2. **Install it.** Copy the VPK to the Vita (VitaShell's USB or FTP mode),
   open it in VitaShell and confirm. The bubble is called **Halo CE**.
3. **Get the game files from your disc.** An Xbox disc image (an `.iso`,
   often called an XISO: the same thing) is unpacked by
   [extract-xiso](https://github.com/XboxDev/extract-xiso):
   `extract-xiso -x "Halo.iso"` makes a folder with the disc's files. You
   need two things from it: the `maps` folder and `default.xbe`. (Already
   unpacked game files, as many backups come, work as they are.)
4. **Copy them to the Vita**, with VitaShell's USB or FTP mode:

   ```
   ux0:data/haloce-vita/maps/         <- the whole maps folder (ui.map, a10.map, bloodgulch.map ...)
   ux0:data/haloce-vita/default.xbe   <- the loading screen's picture is read from it
   ```

5. **Start the game.** The first load of each level takes a while: the
   game writes a cache file for it to the memory card.

Without the maps the game shows where to copy them and exits.

### Updating

Install the new `halo.vpk` over the old one. Your maps, saves and settings
in `ux0:data/haloce-vita/` are kept.

### Movies (optional)

The Xbox movies are Bink files, which the Vita cannot play. Convert them
(the disc's `bink` folder) to H.264 MP4 and put them in
`ux0:data/haloce-vita/movies/` under the same names (`intro.mp4`,
`credits.mp4`, `attract1.mp4` ...):

```
ffmpeg -i intro.bik -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -level 3.1 -pix_fmt yuv420p \
       -vf scale=640:-2 -c:a aac -b:a 128k intro.mp4
```

A movie without an MP4 is skipped, as the game skips a missing movie.

### Saving

Checkpoints are kept with **Save and Quit** from the pause menu; choose the
campaign again to resume. Closing the game from the home screen keeps the
levels you reached, but not the checkpoint, as on the Xbox.

## Controls

| Vita | In game |
| --- | --- |
| Left stick / right stick | move / look |
| R / L | fire / throw grenade |
| Cross | jump |
| Circle | melee |
| Square | reload, action |
| Triangle | switch weapon |
| D-pad down / up | crouch / zoom |
| D-pad left / right | switch grenades / flashlight |
| Start | pause; skips a cinematic |
| Select | scoreboard |
| Select + Start (hold) | settings panel |

## Settings panel

Hold Select + Start for a second. Up and down choose a setting, left and
right change it, Circle closes the panel. Changes apply at once (the render
resolution and sound voices after a restart) and are kept in
`ux0:data/haloce-vita/settings.txt`.

The defaults favour frame rate: lower model detail at a distance, tiny
distant objects skipped, static props and object lighting updated less
often, sounds' muffling behind walls rechecked less often, and a 75%
render resolution. Set model detail High, distant objects Off, scenery and
lighting to every tick, sound occlusion every tick and the resolution to
100% to see and hear the game exactly as on the Xbox. Sound voices can play
fewer positional sounds at once for speed.

## Building

### What you need

- Linux (or WSL on Windows) with **Python 3**, **ninja** and **clang 17 or
  newer** (the game code is compiled by clang with the game's MSVC-like ABI).
- **[VitaSDK](https://vitasdk.org)** for the Vita side (compiled by its
  GCC) and the packaging tools. Install it with
  [vdpm](https://github.com/vitasdk/vdpm) and set `VITASDK` (or put it in
  `~/vitasdk`).

For example, on Ubuntu or Debian:

```
sudo apt install git python3 ninja-build clang lld curl
export VITASDK=/usr/local/vitasdk
export PATH=$VITASDK/bin:$PATH        # (add both lines to ~/.bashrc)
git clone https://github.com/vitasdk/vdpm && cd vdpm
./bootstrap-vitasdk.sh && ./install-all.sh && cd ..
```

### Build

```
git clone https://github.com/BirchWoodGod/halo-ce-vita
cd halo-ce-vita
python3 configure.py --lto off --pgo off --portable --release
ninja vita
```

The results are `build/vita/eboot.bin` and `build/vita/halo.vpk`. Install
the VPK as above, or, with an FTP server running on the Vita (VitaShell's
SELECT), replace just the executable:

```
curl -T build/vita/eboot.bin ftp://<vita address>:1337/ux0:/app/HCEV00001/eboot.bin
```

Run `configure.py` again after adding a source file or changing anything in
`port/vita/sce_sys` (the LiveArea images and the title).
[port/vita/README.md](port/vita/README.md) has the details: the layout of
`port/vita`, testing in [Vita3K](https://vita3k.org) and in a Linux build of
the Vita renderer, debug switches, and the files the game keeps on the
memory card.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Open work:

- **Performance** in the biggest fights: the render on the first core is
  the limit.
- **Ad hoc multiplayer** between two Vitas without a router, then online
  play.
- **Draw count**: objects are drawn one part at a time (about 270 of the
  ~360 draws in a big fight); batching them would help the most.

### Reporting a crash or a problem

Open an [issue](https://github.com/BirchWoodGod/halo-ce-vita/issues) with
what you were doing (level, place, weapon, vehicle) and these files from
the memory card (VitaShell's FTP or USB mode):

- `ux0:data/haloce-vita/halo.log` and `halo-prev.log`: the port's logs of
  this and the previous session (the previous one is the crashed one after
  a restart).
- After a crash, the newest `ux0:data/psp2core-....psp2dmp`: the crash
  dump. Leave the Vita alone for a minute after a crash so it finishes
  writing it (a dump still being written ends in `.tmp`).
- `ux0:data/haloce-vita/data/debug.txt`: the game's own log.

## Credits

This port stands on a lot of other people's work:

- **Bungie** made Halo: Combat Evolved. Halo is a trademark of Microsoft.
- **[punpckhdq/halo](https://github.com/punpckhdq/halo)**: the decompilation
  of the Xbox build 2342 (`cachebeta.exe`, SHA-256
  `4cc87b45f721270392a96f1674ed2b5cd4a7bb4355faeab4531d1cf1884d9520`),
  including the decompiled Xbox libraries in `libs/` (Direct3D 8, the C
  runtime, XAPI, Bink).
- **[bnunu/halo-1](https://github.com/bnunu/halo-1)**: the fork of that
  decompilation the native port starts from.
- **[cybersecurity/halo-ce-universal](https://github.com/cybersecurity/halo-ce-universal)**:
  the native Linux, Windows and Android port this repository is built on:
  the platform layer, the OpenGL renderer the Vita renderer is modelled on,
  the distributed netcode, system link over the internet, and much more.
  Those platforms still build from this tree (`port/linux`, `port/windows`,
  `port/android`, each with its own README).
- **[Invader](https://github.com/SnowyMouse/invader)** by SnowyMouse: the
  tag definitions `port/linux/src/tag_layouts.h` is generated from (by
  `tools/gen_tag_layouts.py`), which let the port relocate the maps' tags.
- **[Xita](https://github.com/Xita-Project/xita)**: the earlier work on running Halo on the Vita, whose
  findings (the register combiner translation, the GPU and threading
  lessons, the tools) went into this port.
- **PS Vita port & LibGxm backend**: [BirchWoodGod/halo-ce-vita](https://github.com/BirchWoodGod/halo-ce-vita).
